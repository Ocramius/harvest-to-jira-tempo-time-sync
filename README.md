# Harvest to Tempo (Jira) time sync

In this project, I sync my time logs from my [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) to
a [Tempo](https://www.tempo.io/) installation.

The reason? Ain't nobody got time for this.

Harvest has a **GOOD** and **SIMPLE** UI, while Tempo has a dreadful SPA design that loads
in a gazillion years, and that constantly freezes my browser, due to it requiring absurd
amounts of CPU/Memory to render timesheets.

On top of that, Jira sucks balls.

Developers, please, stop putting Jabbascript on everything: it's not needed.
